# DOCTer

DOCTer is an open-source framework designed for diagnosing consciousness disorders using EEG (electroencephalography) data through deep learning techniques. This repository aims to provide researchers and developers with a robust tool for analyzing and diagnosing consciousness-related disorders from EEG signals.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms for diagnosing consciousness disorders.
- **EEG Data Support**: Compatible with various EEG data formats for seamless integration.
- **Complete Workflow**: Includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing diagnosis results and model performance.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DOCTer.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd DOCTer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Prepare your EEG data by placing it in the `data/` directory. Then, run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess.py --input data/your_eeg_data --output processed_data
```

### Model Training

Train the deep learning model with the preprocessed data:

```bash
python train.py --data processed_data --epochs 50
```

### Model Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance using:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model saved_model --data test_data
```

### Diagnosis

Use the trained model to diagnose new EEG data:

```bash
python diagnose.py --model saved_model --input new_eeg_data
```

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to use the DOCTer framework:

```python
from docter import Model

# Load the pre-trained model
model = Model.load('saved_model')

# Load new EEG data
eeg_data = read_eeg_data('data/new_eeg_data')

# Perform diagnosis
result = model.diagnose(eeg_data)

print("Diagnosis Result:", result)
```
